uspGetBillOfMaterials,"1. The stored procedure 'uspGetBillOfMaterials' serves the business function of generating a multi-level Bill of Materials (BOM), which is a comprehensive list of components, assemblies, and sub-assemblies needed to manufacture a product.
2. It works with data from the 'Production' database, specifically the 'BillOfMaterials' and 'Product' tables, and produces a detailed list of components including their quantity, standard cost, and list price, for a given product ID and a specific date.
3. The key business logic it implements is the recursive query that fetches all levels of components for a product assembly, while also considering the start and end dates of the components' usage in the product, thereby ensuring that any components no longer used in the product after the specified date are excluded.",2,37,Contains JOIN operations (1.5x multiplier); Small procedure (37 lines),Never executed
uspGetEmployeeManagers,"1. The stored procedure 'uspGetEmployeeManagers' serves the business function of retrieving a hierarchical list of managers for a specific employee, identified by their BusinessEntityID.
2. It works with data from the 'Employee' and 'Person' tables, producing a list that includes the employee's ID, first name, last name, job title, and the names of their managers at each level of the organization.
3. The procedure uses a recursive query to traverse the organization hierarchy, limiting the depth of recursion to 25 levels to prevent excessive processing, and orders the output by the level of management and the organization node.",2,34,Contains JOIN operations (1.5x multiplier); Small procedure (34 lines),Never executed
uspGetManagerEmployees,"1. This stored procedure, uspGetManagerEmployees, serves the business function of retrieving a list of employees who report directly or indirectly to a specific manager, identified by their BusinessEntityID.
2. It works with data from the Employee and Person tables, producing a list that includes the manager's name, each employee's BusinessEntityID, first and last name, and their position in the organizational hierarchy.
3. The procedure uses a recursive query to traverse the organizational hierarchy, limiting the depth of recursion to 25 levels to prevent excessive processing, and orders the output by the level of recursion and the organization node, effectively presenting the employees in the order of their reporting structure.",2,34,Contains JOIN operations (1.5x multiplier); Small procedure (34 lines),Never executed
uspGetWhereUsedProductID,"1. This stored procedure, uspGetWhereUsedProductID, serves the business function of providing a detailed breakdown of the components used in a product assembly, including their costs and quantities, at any given date.
2. It works with data from the 'BillOfMaterials' and 'Product' tables, producing a list of components (with their descriptions, quantities, costs, and prices), the product assemblies they belong to, and their respective levels in the assembly hierarchy.
3. The procedure implements business rules to only include components that are valid within the given date, and it uses a recursive query to traverse through multiple levels of product assemblies, up to a maximum of 25 levels deep.",2,35,Contains JOIN operations (1.5x multiplier); Small procedure (35 lines),Never executed
uspLogError,"1. The stored procedure 'uspLogError' serves the business function of logging error information that occurs during the execution of other database operations, providing a record for troubleshooting and system improvement.
2. It works with error data such as the user who encountered the error, error number, severity, state, procedure, line, and message, and it produces an ErrorLogID that uniquely identifies each logged error in the ErrorLog table.
3. The procedure implements key business rules such as not logging error information if there is no error or if the system is in an uncommittable transaction state, and it provides feedback to the user about the state of the transaction and the success or failure of the error logging process.",3,61,Contains conditional logic; Contains error handling; Contains transaction management; Calls other procedures/functions; Creates database objects; Medium-sized procedure (61 lines),Never executed
uspPrintError,"1. The stored procedure 'uspPrintError' serves the business function of identifying and reporting errors that occur during the execution of other database operations.
2. It works with error data produced during these operations, specifically the error number, severity, state, procedure where it occurred, and the line of code that triggered it.
3. The key logic it implements is to capture this error information and print it out, providing valuable insights for troubleshooting and improving the robustness of the database operations.",0,18,Contains error handling; Calls other procedures/functions; Small procedure (18 lines),Never executed
uspSearchCandidateResumes,"1. The stored procedure 'uspSearchCandidateResumes' serves the business function of searching through candidate resumes based on a provided search string, with options to use inflectional forms of words and/or a thesaurus for more comprehensive results.
2. It works with data from the 'JobCandidate' table in the 'HumanResources' database, specifically the 'JobCandidateID' and 'RANK' fields, and produces a list of candidate IDs and their corresponding ranks based on the search criteria.
3. The procedure implements business rules to handle different search scenarios: if both inflectional and thesaurus options are selected, it uses a 'FREETEXTTABLE' search; if only the thesaurus option is selected, it uses a 'CONTAINSTABLE' search with thesaurus forms; if only the inflectional option is selected, it uses a 'CONTAINSTABLE' search with inflectional forms; and if neither option is selected, it performs a basic 'CONTAINSTABLE' search.",4,56,Contains JOIN operations (1.5x multiplier); Contains conditional logic; Calls other procedures/functions; Creates database objects; Medium-sized procedure (56 lines),Never executed
uspUpdateEmployeeHireInfo,"1. The stored procedure 'uspUpdateEmployeeHireInfo' serves the business function of updating an employee's job title, hire date, and current status, as well as logging their pay rate changes.
2. It works with data from the 'Employee' and 'EmployeePayHistory' tables in the 'HumanResources' database, specifically dealing with fields such as BusinessEntityID, JobTitle, HireDate, CurrentFlag, RateChangeDate, Rate, and PayFrequency.
3. The key business logic it implements includes maintaining data integrity by using transactions, which ensures that either all updates are successfully made or none are, and error handling, which logs any errors that occur during the process.",2,43,Contains conditional logic; Contains error handling; Contains transaction management; Calls other procedures/functions; Creates database objects; Small procedure (43 lines),Never executed
uspUpdateEmployeeLogin,"The stored procedure 'uspUpdateEmployeeLogin' serves the business function of updating an employee's login information and other related details in the Human Resources system. It works with data such as the employee's unique ID, organization node, login ID, job title, hire date, and current status. If the procedure encounters an error while updating the information, it implements a rule to log that error for further investigation.",1,26,Contains error handling; Calls other procedures/functions; Small procedure (26 lines),Never executed
uspUpdateEmployeePersonalInfo,"1. The stored procedure 'uspUpdateEmployeePersonalInfo' serves the business function of updating an employee's personal information in the Human Resources system.
2. It works with data such as the employee's National ID number, birth date, marital status, and gender, and updates these details in the Employee database.
3. If there is an error during the update process, the procedure implements a business rule to log the error using another procedure called 'uspLogError', ensuring that any issues are properly tracked and can be addressed.",1,24,Contains error handling; Calls other procedures/functions; Small procedure (24 lines),Never executed
